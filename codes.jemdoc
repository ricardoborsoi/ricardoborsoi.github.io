==== [https://github.com/ricardoborsoi/unmixing_spectral_variability SU-VAR toolbox]
Description: This software package provides a complete toolbox for hyperspectral unmixing considering spectral (endmember) variability. It includes realistic synthetic data generation routines, library extraction methods, and unmixing algorithms that follow different frameworks. It is related to the following review paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07307.pdf R.A.~Borsoi et~al. "Spectral Variability in Hyperspectral Data Unmixing: A Comprehensive Review", IEEE GRSM, 2021].



==== [https://github.com/ricardoborsoi/CB_STAR_release CB-STAR]
Description: This software package provides codes for a hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion algorithm that accounts for both spatially and spectrally localized inter-image changes between the images using a coupled tensor decomposition strategy. It is related to the following publication: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16968.pdf R.A.~Borsoi et~al. "Coupled tensor decomposition for hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion with inter-image variability", IEEE JSTSP, 2021].
